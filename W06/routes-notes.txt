in 'app.module.ts' this is where you will use Routes.
Import Routes from @angular/router
Make a const variable like this:
    const appRoutes: Routes =[
        {path: '', component: HomeComponent}
        {path: 'users', component: UsersComponent}
        {path: 'servers', component: ServersComponent}
    ]

I believe the path is the route. Its they keyword, then 'users' is the url after the dash /. 
component is what page will show up when 'users' url is live.

In app.module.ts, go down to imports and add 'RouterModule.forRoot(appRoots)' there. Remember to import it as well above.

In html file, delete the components, and input <router-outlet></router-outlet>
In your navlinks or wherever, a tags or so, remove the href attribute in that a tag and use routerLink="" instead.
