TypeScript is a "superset" to JavaScript

TS adds more to the JS syntax. It adds static typing to JS.

TS code doesn't run in the browser. It will fail if you do so. You need to compile TS into JS.

After installing the TS npm, you gotta run 'npx tsc'

Angular and Angular 2 are totally different from one another.
It's a complete rewrite.

A new version released every 6 months.

Also, all Angulars (Angular 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on...) are referred to as just: Angular :)
